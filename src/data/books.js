        pdf: '/downloads/jerusalem-adventure.pdf',
        brief: "In 1970s Jerusalem, an American family opens a youth‑hostel coffeehouse and discovers faith most alive on the edge—through debates, hospitality, close calls, and grace.",
        description: 'Thailand Adventure is a first-person memoir of a missionary family’s 20-plus years in Thailand—equal parts travelogue, family chronicle, and on-the-ground ministry diary. From launching a grassroots Bible school after a TV ministry is shut down, to trekking by bamboo-lamp to hill-tribe homes for night meetings, the book captures the grit and grace of everyday service in rural villages and coastal towns. \n' +
            'Along the way, intimate family milestones—courtship and marriage, a late-in-life birth, and eventually the adoption of a boy named Rosen—unfold against Thailand’s vivid cultural backdrop.\n' +
            ' Candid chapters also confront hard realities: child trafficking, the sex trade’s toll on families, and the AIDS crisis—threads that reveal why the work mattered and how hope took root in unlikely places. \n' +

            'Told with humility, humor, and a traveler’s eye for detail, Thailand  Adventure invites readers into a lived story of faith, culture, and compassion—where small acts of love ripple across mountains, markets, and generations.',

        brief: "A 20‑plus‑year journey across Thailand—part travelogue, part ministry diary—where small acts of love ripple across mountains, markets, and generations.",
        description: 'Set against the tensions and wonder of 1970s Jerusalem, Jerusalem Adventure follows an American missionary family who trades comfort for calling and discovers that faith is most alive on the edge. Landing with little more than backpacks and a bold vision, they open a humble youth-hostel coffeehouse that becomes a crossroads for Israelis, Arab neighbors, travelers, and newly arrived immigrants. \n' +
            '\n' +
            'There are late-night debates and quiet conversions, street music and scripture, answered prayers and close calls. When war erupts, air-raid sirens, shortages, and uncertainty press the family to the limits—yet doors keep opening, needs are met in unlikely ways, and grace shows up in the everyday. \n' +
            '\n' +
            'With vivid scenes and an honest voice, the memoir records healings and heartbreaks, baptisms and bureaucracies, and the stubborn joy of serving in a city holy to many and easy for none. Part travelogue, part ministry diary, this is a true story about risk, resilience, and the relentless love of God.',
